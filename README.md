# Open Data Portal Requirements

### Introduction
This document contains a set of sample requirements to help governments evaluate, develop (or procure), deploy, and launch an open data web site (portal).

### Terms
The following terms are used throughout the requirements to indicate importance.

* **Must** denotes a requirement that is critical to the successful implementation of the open data portal. If this requirement is not met, it will significantly impair the use or management of the site.
* **May** denotes a requirement that is optional, but highly desirable for success.

### Roles
The following roles are used throughout this document to approximate to whom each requirement is relevant. They are not intended to reflect a permission system, which might be implemented by a technology solution.

* A **user** is anyone who visits the portal to find, and access, and use data.
* Typically, a **publisher** is a government employee who is responsible for publishing or updating data and other content on the portal.
* Typically, an **administrator** is a government employee who manages the technical and configuration options of the portal, such as visual themes, metadata requirements, etc.

Generally, a publisher can do anything a user can do, and an administrator can do anything a publisher can do.

## Data Catalog Features
A data catalog is a listing of available data, with each catalog entry corresponding to one or more data resources. It usually includes high-level information for each dataset, such as Title, Description, Release Date, Category(-ies), and Keyword(s).

* must be able to view a summary page for each dataset which details data resources, metadata, and other relevant documentation
* may be able to search for datasets by terms contained in the data

### Publishers
* must be able to add, edit, or remove catalog entries
